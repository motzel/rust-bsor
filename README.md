[BS Open Replay](https://github.com/BeatLeader/BS-Open-Replay) Rust parser

Disclaimer: This is my Rust learning project, so expect bugs and non-idomatic code

## Known limitations

The current version does not support replays that do not conform to the BL Open Replays specification saved by a very old version of the Beat Leader mod (incorrect utf8 string encoding). A failing test for this edge case has been added (ignored for now), will probably be implemented in version 0.4.0.

## Install

Run following Cargo command in your project directory

```sh
cargo add bsor
```

Or add the following line to your ``[dependencies]`` section of the ``Cargo.toml``:

```toml
bsor = "0.3"
```

## Usage

Loading the entire replay into memory:

```rust
use bsor::prelude::*;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;

fn main() {
    let mut br = BufReader::new(File::open("example.bsor").unwrap());

    let replay = Replay::load(&mut br).unwrap();

    println!("{:#?}", replay);
}
```

Since you may rarely need the full replay structure (especially Frames block) and at the same time would like to keep memory usage low, there is also the option of loading only selected blocks (keep in mind that Header and Info blocks are always loaded). 

Note: Unlike ``Replay::load()``, which requires any ``Read`` reader as an argument, ``ParsedReplay::parse()`` requires ``Read + Seek`` reader

```rust
use bsor::prelude::*;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;

fn main() {
    let mut br = BufReader::new(File::open("example.bsor").unwrap());

    let replay_index = ReplayIndex::index(br).unwrap();
    
    let notes = replay_index.notes.load(br).unwrap();
    
    println!(
        "Info: {:#?}\nNotes count: {:#?}",
        replay_index.info,
        notes.len()
    );

    if !notes.is_empty() {
        let notes_count = notes.len();
        let idx = notes_count / 2;
        println!(
            "Note[{}] = {:#?}",
            idx, notes[idx]
        );
    } else {
        println!("Replay contains no notes ðŸ¤”");
    }
}

```

The memory savings can be significant, for example, for an average replay of 1375kB:

| Block         | Memory usage |
|---------------|--------------|
| Whole replay  | 1383kB       |
| Header + Info | 9kB          |
| Frames        | 1255kB       |
| Notes         | 137kB        |

# Tests

Crate is fully tested according to the BL Open Replay specification, but keep in mind that actual replays may differ slightly from it, for example, older versions of the BL mod incorrectly encoded utf8 strings. If you come across a replay that crate cannot read please report it in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/motzel/rust-bsor/issues), along with a link.
